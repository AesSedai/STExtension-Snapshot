# STExtension-Snapshot
Takes a snapshot of the current chat and makes an image of it for easy sharing.
***
Has two modes, 
1. "regular" which creates a long vertical list of the messages, pretty much a giant version of what you see in SillyTavern.
2. "grid" which makes a column based grid of messages in a rectangular shape.

You can trigger a snapshot through the two buttons in the extensions menu, or by typing /snapshot {optional: grid}.

Thanks to dom-to-image-more!
